Throw attempt states have a HitDef of a\r\n;     special format. The key parameters in a throw are p1stateno\r\n;     and p2stateno.

The special thing about p2stateno\r\n;     is that the opponent will be temporarily brought into the\r\n;     attacker's state file. In this case, no matter who the\r\n;     opponent is, he will be taken to state 820 of this file (kfm.cns)\r\n;     and remain here until the end of the throw (look at his debug\r\n;     information when he is being thrown; the text changes to yellow\r\n;     to mean that he is in another player's state file).\r\n[Statedef 800]\r\ntype    = S\r\nmovetype= A\r\nphysics = S\r\njuggle  = 0\r\nvelset = 0,0\r\nctrl = 0\r\nanim = 800\r\nsprpriority = 2\r\n\r\n; Notes: The '-' symbol in the hitflag field means that it only affects\r\n;   players who are not in a hit state.

For\r\n;     example, [State 810, Bind 1] binds the opponent to an offset of\r\n;     28 pixels in front of KFM. That puts him around where KFM's hand\r\n;     is at. Is is important to keep the opponent bound using a\r\n;     TargetBind controller at all times, until you let him go. This\r\n;     is especially important if your player has a Clsn2 box that\r\n;     allows him to get hit while throwing someone. Each time a player\r\n;     gets hit, all his bound targets will be set to a fall state.

Kung Fu Knee\r\n; CNS difficulty: medium\r\n; Description: Like the Kung Fu Palm, this is a special attack. This attack\r\n;     begins on the ground, launches KFM into the air, then ends when KFM\r\n;     lands on the ground. To achieve this, we use three states. The first\r\n;     has KFM starting on the ground (note that type = S in the Statedef).\r\n;     The ChangeState controller brings KFM into the second state (state\r\n;     1051) when his ground animation ends. The second state controls KFM's\r\n;     movement into the air and back towards the ground. The last state\r\n;     (state 1052) stops KFM from moving when he touches the ground, and\r\n;     brings him back to his stand state (state 0) when the animation is\r\n;     over.

A value of 2,-6 means 2 pixels/tick forwards, and\r\n;     6 pixels/tick upwards. Since this is an aerial state, the type is set\r\n;     to A in the Statedef.\r\n;     Notice that physics = N (N for None) here. This means we are not using\r\n;     the built-in aerial physics model (physics = A), so we have complete\r\n;     control over what KFM does in this state. Since we do not have\r\n;     physics = A to take care of gravity for us, we need to put in our own\r\n;     controller for that. Controller 1051,1 does the work of pulling KFM\r\n;     down towards the ground. Controller 1051,2 checks if KFM has reached\r\n;     the ground, and changes to state 1052 if so.\r\n;     In this state's Statedef, we will use the hitdefpersist parameter to\r\n;     retain the HitDef information from the last state.

State entry\r\n; --------------\r\n; This is where you define what commands bring you to what states.\r\n;\r\n; Each state entry block looks like:\r\n;   [State -1, Label]           ;Change Label to any name you want to use to\r\n;                               ;identify the state with.\r\n;   type = ChangeState          ;Don't change this\r\n;   value = new_state_number\r\n;   trigger1 = command = command_name\r\n;   . . .  (any additional triggers)\r\n;\r\n; - new_state_number is the number of the state to change to\r\n; - command_name is the name of the command (from the section above)\r\n; - Useful triggers to know:\r\n;   - statetype\r\n;       S, C or A : current state-type of player (stand, crouch, air)\r\n;   - ctrl\r\n;       0 or 1 : 1 if player has control. Unless \"interrupting\" another\r\n;                move, you'll want ctrl = 1\r\n;   - stateno\r\n;       number of state player is in - useful for \"move interrupts\"\r\n;   - movecontact\r\n;       0 or 1 : 1 if player's last attack touched the opponent\r\n;                useful for \"move interrupts\"\r\n;\r\n; Note: The order of state entry is important.\r\n;   State entry with a certain command must come before another state\r\n;   entry with a command that is the subset of the first.\r\n;   For example, command \"fwd_a\" must be listed before \"a\", and\r\n;   \"fwd_ab\" should come before both of the others.\r\n;\r\n; For reference on triggers, see CNS documentation.\r\n;\r\n; Just for your information (skip if you're not interested):\r\n; This part is an extension of the CNS. \"State -1\" is a special state\r\n; that is executed once every game-tick, regardless of what other state\r\n; you are in.\r\n\r\n\r\n; Don't remove the following line. It's required by the CMD standard.\r\n[Statedef
