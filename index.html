    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p class="indent">
        I'm a person who likes to make things and I have a keen interest in web design.
        This is a site mostly for my reference, but available for anyone to use and also display some of my projects.
        This site uses my own custom responsive CSS library which I call COSMUIC, which is designed to simplify the creation of pages without the need for multiple classes.
        Please enjoy, and I hope that this may help you out find what you are looking for.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
        This site is under construction and currently only officially supports desktop modes.
        The mobile version will come at a later time.
        COSMUIC is responsive though, so COSMUIC can be used for mobile sites.
