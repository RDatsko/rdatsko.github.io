      <h1><b>Hello World!</b></h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my little section of the world wide web!
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        I'm a person who likes to make things and I have experimented with many things from microcontrollers to builiding full fledged gaming PCs.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        I have a keen interest in web design.
        This is a site mostly for my reference, but available for anyone to use and also display some of my projects.
        This site uses my own custom responsive CSS library which I call COSMUIC, which is designed to simplify the creation of pages without the need for multiple classes.
        Please enjoy, and I hope that this may help you out find what you are looking for.
